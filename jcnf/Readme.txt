This is a library supporting system and application configuration stored in
a flat file format based on the JSON format.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse
and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is
completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to
programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript,
Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange
language.

The jcnf library is designed to be used stand alone by applications,
or as a template for a back end to Elektra, as an alternative to other
simple flat file formats such as .ini

It makes use of Lloyd Hilaiel's YAJL to do the generation
and parsing of the JSON configuration files.
