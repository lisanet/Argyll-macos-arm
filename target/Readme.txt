This directory containts routines that generate print or
film calibration test charts, based on perceptually evenly
distributed, random sequence points, suitable for reading
using an Xrite DTP51 coloromiter or Xrite DTP41 spectromter
(print) or Gretag Spectrolino (film). The generated print
file is a PostScript file, while the film recorder file is
a TIFF file.

targen		Is used to generate the test point values.

target		Is used to generate a PostScript file from those values.
