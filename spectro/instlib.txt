To create a standalone instrument library, you need a subset of
files from this directory and other selected files from Argyll.

If you are on MSWin you need to build argyll first using Jam.

You can run the instlib.ksh script which will copy the necessary
files into the file instlib.zip.

This can be extracted, the Makefile modified to suite the system,
and then built. (See the Readme.txt within instlib.zip file)
