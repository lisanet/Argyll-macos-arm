    <h2>Where display profiles are stored, and how to load them
      automatically.<br>
    </h2>
    <br>
    Installing a display profile for your monitor is very operating
    system dependent, which is why <a href="dispwin.html#I">dispin -I</a>
    is a good way of taking care of all these details. On some systems
    it is not the operating system itself that supports display
    profiles, but individual applications, or helper programs.<br>
    <br>
    Please choose from the detailed instructions below that suite your
    system:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="#MSW">Microsoft Windows</a><br>
      <a href="#OSX">Apple OS X</a><br>
      <a href="#Linux">Linux/UNIX X11</a></span><br>
    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a name="MSW"></a>On <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Microsoft Windows</span>, display
    profiles are typically in one of the following directories:<br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS Windows Me and 98: C:\Windows\System\Color<br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS Windows NT:
      C:\Winnt\system32\spool\drivers\color </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS Window 2000, XP, Vista and 7:
      C:\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\color</p>
    <p>An alternative to using <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispwin
        -I</span> to install your display profiles, is to use the
      Display Property dialog, advanced settings, Color management tab,
      and locate the profile and install it there. This in itself does
      not cause the profile to be made use of anywhere in your system.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you are using Adobe Photoshop on your system, then you can
      tell it to use your monitor profile by editing the appropriate
      registry key, typically "My
      Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Adobe\Color\Monitor\Monitor0",
      to contain the name of the display profile, and then restart
      Photoshop This is the simplest way of ensuring that the Adobe
      calibration loader tool Adobe Gamma loads the video hardware
      lookup tables from the vcgt tag, and uses the profile as its
      display profile.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The adobe gamma tool can be told to use your profile, but the
      procedure is slightly tricky: Open adobe gamma from photoshop (in
      the Help-&gt;Color Management... menu item), select "Open Adobe
      Gamma", and select the "Load.." button. Select your profile and
      "Open". Select "OK" in the Adobe Gamma, it will then ask you to
      save it's modified version of your profile under a different name.
      Chose a name for the modified profile, and save it. Exit from
      Photoshop. Copy the profile you want to use, over the modified
      profile that you saved in Adobe Gamma. (If you don't do the last
      step, the profile Photoshop will be using will have been modified
      in strange ways from what you intended.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>Installing a profile on Microsoft Windows generally doesn't mean
      that the profiles calibration will be automatically loaded into a
      display on startup. A separated tool is usually needed to achieve
      this.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Some Microsoft Windows applications may come with
      "Gamma/VCGT/RAMDAC/Video LUT" loader tools, so consult their
      documentation and check your Start Menu Startup folders. If you
      don't want to use any of these 3rd party tools, you can also use
      the <a href="dispwin.html">dispwin</a>
      tool to do this for you, as it takes either a <a
        href="cal_format.html">.cal</a> or ICC
      file as an argument. The <a
        href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/xcalib/">xcalib</a> tool
      could also be used.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To add a startup item that will load a profiles calibration into
      the display using <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispwin</span>,
      use the following instructions:<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">On the task bar, right click and
      select "Properties", then select the "Advanced" tab, then click
      "Add..". then browse till you locate dispwin.exe. In the box
      containing the path to <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispwin.exe</span>,
      add a space then the option <span style="font-weight: bold;">-L</span>,
      eg:<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">c:\bin\argyll\dispwin -L</span></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you don't want to use the default
      installed profile, you could explicitly set the calibration file
      to use as an argument:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">c:\bin\argyll\dispwin
        c:\myprofiles\mydisplay.icm<br>
      </span></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Click "Next &gt;", select the
      "Startup" folder, then name the item (ie. "Argyll Calibration
      Loader"), then press "Finish".<br>
      <br>
      You can test it out by simply navigating the "Start" menu to the
      "Startup" folder and selecting the item you've just created. If
      you want to alter any of the details, navigate to the item again
      and right click it, and select "Properties". More than one startup
      item can be created to set the calibration for more than one
      display. You may want to cut and paste the "Target" line to a
      normal Command Prompt shell to check that it works as expected, as
      it is impossible to catch error messages in the startup.<br>
    </p>
    Microsoft Windows <span style="font-weight: bold;">XP</span> has an
    optional <span style="font-weight: bold;">Microsoft&nbsp;Color&nbsp;Control&nbsp;Panel&nbsp;Applet&nbsp;for&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;XP</span>
    available for download from Microsoft, which handles installation
    and registering of the a display profile, and will also
    automatically set the display calibration on system startup. The
    applet is started from the control panel, and first you have to
    "Install..." the profile in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Profiles</span>
    tab, then associate it with the display in the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Devices</span> tab, but <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span> that it seems to have a <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">bug</span>, in that it sometimes
    associates the profiles with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">wrong
      monitor</span> entry!<br>
    <br>
    On Microsoft <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vista</span> you can
    set the display profile in
    Control&nbsp;Panel&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Hardware&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sound
    -&gt;&nbsp;Color&nbsp;Management, as an alternative to <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">dispwin -I</span>.&nbsp;In&nbsp;Devices&nbsp;
you&nbsp;select&nbsp;"Use&nbsp;my&nbsp;settings&nbsp;for&nbsp;this
device",&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;profile&nbsp;you've&nbsp;created.
Unfortunately

    though, it doesn't use the 'vcgt' calibration curves on system
    startup, so a tool such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispwin</span>
    will still have to be used to do this. Note that currently Vista
    also has a <span style="font-weight: bold;">bug</span> that causes
    the calibration curves to be reset whenever the User Account Dialog
    (and similar) is displayed. This problem can only be worked around
    manually, by re-running the startup item whenever this happens. Note
    that due to the details of this bug it is necessary to actually
    reset the calibration to something else before re-setting it. This
    can be done quite conveniently in dispwin by adding the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">-c</span> flag: e.g.: <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">c:\bin\argyll\dispwin -c -L</span><br>
    <br>
    On Microsoft <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows 7 &amp; 8</span>
    you can set the display profile by opening the <span class="phrase">Color

      Management control by clicking the <span class="ui">Start</span>
      button and then clicking <span class="ui">Control Panel</span>.
      In the search box, type <span class="userInput">color management</span>,
      and then click <span class="ui">Color Management</span>.</span>
    Make sure the correct display device is selected in "Device:", and
    then tick the "Use my settings for this device" box. Select "Add..."
    and then "Browse..." to locate and load the profile. (Alternately
    you can use the normal file browser to locate the profile, and then
    right click on it and select "Install Profile". In the Color Manager
    "Add..." dialog you can then select it.). Make sure that the new
    profile has been marked "(default)" if you want it to be
    automatically used for your display.<br>
    <br>
    By default Windows 7 &amp; 8 seems to automatically load the default
    display profiles calibration on startup, but needs to be told to do
    this at all other times by changing the system defaults, or if some
    3rd party tool to load display calibration has been installed. This
    can be done by logging on with a user account that has
    administrative privileges, then opening the <span class="phrase">Color
      Management (see above), and then select the "</span><span
      class="ui">Advanced</span>" tab, and then "<span class="ui">Change
      system defaults...", then select the </span><span class="phrase">"</span><span
      class="ui">Advanced</span>" tab, and select/un-select the "<span
      class="ui">Use <span class="notLocalizable">Windows</span>
      display calibration</span>" check box. (You could use <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">dispwin -I</span> as an alternative to
    this if you really wanted.)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a name="OSX"></a>On <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Apple OSX</span>, the display profile
    are in one of the following locations:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /Network/Library/ColorSync/Profiles<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /System/Library/Colorsync/Profiles<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /Library/ColorSync/Profiles<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~/Library/ColorSync/Profiles<br>
    <br>
    Note though that&nbsp; /System/Library/Colorsync/Profiles is only
    for profiles supplied by Apple. You can use <a
      href="dispwin.html#S">dispwin -S</a>&nbsp; to select the
    appropriate scope when installing a profile using <a
      href="dispwin.html#I">dispwin -I</a>. You can use the "System
    Preferences-&gt;Displays-&gt;Color" tool to check that the profile
    has been installed correctly. Note that the contents of the
    description tag (the argument to the <span style="font-weight:
      bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">-D</span></span> flag used
    with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">colprof</span> tool) will
    be used to identify the profile.<br>
    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a name="Linux"></a>On <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Linux</span> and other <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Unix</span> style systems, there is no
    universally agreed location for ICC profiles yet, although the
    following locations have been suggested at various times:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/share/color/icc<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/local/share/color/icc<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~/.color/icc<br>
    <br>
    although particular applications may use their own locations, such
    as:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/local/share/Scribus/profiles<br>
    <br>
    Argyll <a href="dispwin.html">dispwin</a> follows uses the <a
      href="ucmm.html">ucmm</a> scheme for storing user and system
    display profiles, and when a display is set to use a profile
    correctly, it will follow <a
      href="http://www.burtonini.com/computing/x-icc-profiles-spec-0.2.html">this

      convention</a> to make it available to applications.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    If you want the display calibration to be loaded, you should
    consider installing a tool to do so at startup, such as <a
      href="dispwin.html">dispwin</a> or <a
      href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/xcalib/">xcalib</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Using <a href="dispwin.html">dispwin</a> the currently installed
    profile for a particular display can be loaded using the <a
      href="dispwin.html#L">-L</a> option of <a href="dispwin.html">dispwin:</a><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispwin -L</span><span
      style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <br>
    </span>which will both upload the installed profile <span
      style="font-style: italic;"></span>into the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span>root window _ICC_PROFILE
    property, and also load it into the display VideoLUTs. <br>
    <br>
    You can use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispwin</span> <a
      href="dispwin.html#d">-d</a> parameter
    in the usual way to select other displays to store or load the
    calibration using the _ICC_PROFILE property.<br>
    <br>
    To do this when you start your X11 server, you could put the above
    command in your <span style="font-weight: bold;">.xinitrc</span>
    file in your home directory for each screen.<br>
