    You will need to unzip the downloaded file in the location you have
    chosen to hold the executable files (perhaps somewhere like <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">\bin</span>). I would <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> put them in <span
      style="font-style: italic;">\Program Files</span>, since spaces in
    directory or file names and command line environments are a very bad
    mix, and will cause you endless problems. The archive will create a
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> top level directory <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X</span>, where X.X.X is
    the version number, and the executables will be in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X\bin</span>.
    <h3><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Making the tools

    You should also configure your %PATH% environment variable to give
    access to the executables from your command line environment.<br>

    You want to add the directory you've chosen to your %PATH%, which is
    a System Variable. Normally you would add this to the end of the
    current setting, separated by a ';'.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;So if the current value of PATH is
    "%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%" and you unpacked Argyll version
    1.8.0 in <span style="font-weight: bold;">d:\bin\</span>, then you
    would modify PATH to be
    "%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;d:\bin\Argyll_V1.8.0\bin", -
    i.e. you append the path to the Argyll binaries to your PATH,
    separated by the ';' character. The change will take effect when you
    start a new command shell, which you start from Start
    Menu-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt, or Start
    Menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt. You can check
    that the environment variable has been set by running the command
    "echo %PATH%" in the command shell.<br>
    <br>
    The .zip file also contains several useful reference files (such as
    scanner chart recognition templates, sample illumination spectrum
    etc.) in the ref sub-directory, all the current documentation in a
    doc sub-directory, and instrument USB drivers in the usb directory.<br>

    now you know.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: Microsofts generic VGA Driver</span>
    does not appear to support setting the graphics card VideoLUTs. You
    will need to install a display driver for your specific display
    hardware to enable this. Note that it is possible in many cases to
    use Windows 7 video drivers on Windows 8 systems. If you are having
    trouble accessing the VideoLUTs, then check in Device Manager that
    you are running the correct driver for your card, and not using the
    fallback generic driver.<br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span> that if you wish to use
    Argyll tools (<a href="dispwin.html">dispwin</a>) to control display
    calibration, that you will have to disable any other display
    calibration loader programs.<br>
    <br>
    There are other programs that will interfere with calibration
    loading, such as igfxpers.exe that gets installed with nVidia
    "Optimus" technology.<br>
    You may have to disable both the igfx tray module
    (c:\windows\system32\igfxtray.exe) and the igfxpph Module
    (c:\windows\system32\igfxpph.dll) in addition to the persistence
    Module (c:\windows\system32\igfxpers.exe).<br>
    <br>
    A good tool for this is <a
      href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902">AutoRuns</a>.
    Note that the igfxpph module may exist in several locations and you
    have to disable all of them. Reboot after changing settings.<br>

      <br>
    </span>If you currently don't have any applications that talk to
    your instrument using USB, then it is relatively simple to use the
    drivers provided with Argyll, since you don't have to deal with the
    instrument already having an assigned driver.<br>
    <br>
    Windows 8/8.1/10 does not automatically pop up a "New Hardware"
    dialog, so you will have to open the Device Manager manually, and
    you will also have to temporarily disable UBS driver .inf signature
    enforcement.<br>
    <br>
    Please <b>NOTE</b> that on some versions of Windows 10, you may
    have to temporarily <b>disable secure boot</b> in your UEFI BIOS to
    be able to Disable Driver Signature Enforcement.<br>
    <br>
    If you <u>often</u> want to switch between using ArgyllCMS and the
    OEM driver, you can try using a different physical USB port for each
    installation, as this reportedly avoids the need to manually switch
    drivers.<br>

    re-install to update the relevant libusb system driver and .inf
