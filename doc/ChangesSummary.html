    <h1> Summary of Argyll CMS Changes since last release</h1>
    <h3>For a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complete</span>
      and more detailed list of changes, please see the log.txt file.</h3>
    <h1>[V2.1.1 -&gt; V2.1.2] 14th January 2020</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added -d option to spotread to print out Density values.</li>
      <li>Improved i1Pro2 emissive measurement compatibility with X-Rite
        driver.</li>
      <li>Changed targen round down/up to 0%/100% to have a
        tighter&nbsp; tolerance.</li>
      <li>Added -Yk flag to spectro/dispread, to restore a workflow in
        which display calibration is done without using vcgt hardware.</li>
      <li>Modified txt2ti3 to cope with files that don't have
        SampleName/SampleID fields, such as CoPrA sample files.</li>
      <li>Added instrument ambient mode (-a flag) to dispcal, dispread
        and ccxxmake, to allow use of direct projector to ambient mode
        measurement.</li>
      <li>Fixed problem with i1Pro2 EO2-XR-UF model crashing when
        high-res mode used.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal ADJ_THRESH mode MIN_THRESH value to 0.25 from
        0.05, as well as restricting it to the last pass, to reduce
        pointless repeats of dark values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V2.1.0 -&gt; V2.1.1] 29th April 2019</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix typo in usb/55-Argyll.rules for i1Studio.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added SpyderX support for inst_opt_noinitcalib option, so that
        the -N flag can be honoured. (Thanks to Florian Hoch)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V2.0.1 -&gt; V2.1.0] 10th April 2019</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added scanin .cht for Christophe Metairie's Digital Target
        2019 and Digital Target Studio Edition input charts.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added support for Lasersoft ISO12641-2 reflective and 3 part
        transmissive charts (recognition files, cxf2ti3 tool, changes to
        average utility).</li>
      <li>Changed spotread -E option to work with all the spectral
        instruments, and now argument should be a transmission spectrum
        of the filter placed on the instrument.</li>
      <li>Added targen options -M to generate device space cube surface
        steps, and -n option to generate neutral axis steps based on a
        pre-conditioning profile.</li>
      <li>Added support for SpyderX colorimeter.</li>
      <li>Improvements and bug fixes to oeminst and oemdnld.</li>
      <li>Add IES TM-30-15 (Method for Evaluating Light Source Color
        Rendition) to spotread.</li>
      <li>Added optional spectrum save file argument to spotread -O
        option.</li>
      <li>Changed spotread so that plot option -S doesn't wait for a
        keystroke before continuing.</li>
      <li>Fix FWA bugs in spotread - wasn't saving FWA compensated
        spectra, was double correcting reference spectra.</li>
      <li>Changed colprof Display profile -ax option to create just XYZ
        cLUT profiles, rather than including dummy channel swapped
        matrix as well. This will force the use of the cLUT tags in any
        application/CMM that uses an unconventional tag priority when
        dealing with a profile that contains both cLUT and shaper/matrix
        tags. The -aY option has been added to create a diagnostic cLUT
        display profile that contains matrix tags with swapped color
        channels.</li>
      <li>Change black ink "locus" rules (i.e. -K option) to just scale
        from zero to maximum possible K, rather than minimum to maximum
        K. This makes these rules much more usable, since the sharp
        increase in minimum black near the black point will no longer
        badly distort the curve shape. This affects colprof, collink and
        xicclu.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V2.0.0 -&gt; V2.0.1] 9th July 2018</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased maximum render channels to 16<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added -O option to collink to allow creating a link purely
        from calibration file.</li>
      <li>Fixed JETI specbos &amp; specval timeout when in averaging
        mode and dark measurement.</li>
      <li>Changed JETI specval 1511 driver to ignore REMOTE command
        error with newer firmware.</li>
      <li>Changed Klein K10 serial parameters in attempt to prevent
        serial lock up on MSWindows.</li>
      <li>Made a failure of the conf:maxtin command with a JETI 1201 a
        soft error, to allow for old firmware versions.</li>
      <li>Change colorhug Linux driver to reset on close. This may
        overcome a problem re-starting the driver.</li>
      <li>Fixed i1Pro driver to cope with stripped down OEM i1Pro2 that
        is missing one piece of calibration information.</li>
      <li>Fixed display calibration selection to allow for more than 62
        entries. This is to fix problem using Klein K10 that has a lot
        of saved calibrations.</li>
      <li>Changed spec2cie to add extra informational L*a*b* output
        fields, if a non D50 illuminant (-i option) is used.</li>
      <li>Added -w parameter to spotread, to use the -i parameter
        illuminant for L*a*b* calculation.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in spec2cie - XRGA conversion wasn't saving spectrum
        out.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.9.2 -&gt; V2.0.0] 17th November 2017</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for "pm" viewing condition (Print evaluation
        with partial Mid-tone adaptation), and associated m: viewing
        condition parameter. This is intended to address certain
        situations involving the use of papers containing FWA/OBE
        brighteners when viewed in an environment that has a very
        noticeably warmer white point than the paper itself under the
        illuminant.</li>
      <li>Added support for the X-Rite i1Studio instrument. Note that
        you may have to un-install and re-install the system drivers on
        MSWindows, or update the udev 55-Argyll.rules file on Linux.<span
          style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
      <li>Slight improvement to i1d3 accuracy, by rounding the frequency
        mode measurements up by 0.5.</li>
      <li>Returned input profile forced Absolute Colorimetric option
        with -ua flag, after the -u option was changed in V1.5.0.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Try and fix problem in triggering calibration when
        ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE is set.</li>
      <li>Improve compatibility of txt2ti3, and added -D option to mark
        output as Display but not Normalized to white.</li>
      <li>Modified collink to disable Video encoded in/out sync level
        preservation.</li>
      <li>Added support for custom Observer by using a .cmf file as an
        argument to all tools taking an observer parameter.</li>
      <li>Added support for proposed CIE 2012 2 degree &amp; 10 degree
        observers, based on the CIE (2006) 2-deg LMS cone fundamentals.</li>
      <li>Fix problem with dispwin -E option not being shown in usage,
        and only being applied when a calibration file is used.</li>
      <li>Added spotread -u option to display XYZ amd CIE 1976 Yuv
        values.</li>
      <li>Added XRGA conversion support to spec2cie, as well as better
        support in chartread and txt2ti3 for tracking XRGA standard and
        polarization filter use.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in spec2cie processing emissive .sp files.</li>
      <li>Fix problem with i1d3 running direct USB (i.e. Not via HID) on
        MSWin.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in render/timage -p.</li>
      <li>Changed spotread ambient readings (CCT, CRI, TLCI) to show CCT
        delta E in 1960 Duv units and others in Delta E 2000.</li>
      <li>Added ARGYLL_UNTWIST_GAMUT_SURFACE environment variable, that
        enables extra gamut clip surface processing that may improve the
        smoothness of device links and B2A tables for poorly behaved
        devices.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug introduced in new colorimetric nearest clipping code
        in rspl/rev.c in V1.9.0 that caused colprof using some ink limit
        settings (such as -L0) to crash.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug introduced in new colorimetric nearest clipping code
        in rspl/rev.c in V1.9.0 that caused some (mainly XYZ clut)
        profiles to clip badly, causing banding.</li>
      <li>Improved dispcal -R VideoLUT depth measurement algorithm
        robustness.</li>
      <li>Worked around latest OS X super slow opening serial port
        problem (1.5 seconds to open a port!)</li>
      <li>Added ColorCheckerHalfPassport.cht file.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in ChromeCast mDNS parsing that caused problems with
        some devices with long names being detected.</li>
      <li>Now ignoring Chromecast-Audio and (.ca flags &amp; 1) == 0
        devices, and showing the friendly chromecast name if available.</li>
      <li>Wait longer to find more Chromecasts, even if we've found one.</li>
      <li>Fixed colprof bug when handling Display L*a*b* .ti3 data.</li>
      <li>Added Wacom i1d3 support.</li>
      <li>Changed dispwin to by default ignore Gnome colord, and use its
        native ucmm for storage of display profiles, since colord
        support for ArgyllCMS has proven unreliable. This can be
        re-enabled by setting the ARGYLL_USE_COLORD environment variable
        (i.e. to "true").</li>
      <li>Change X11 root window _ICC_PROFILE_xxx atom setting for
        Xrandr case to now match the Xinerama order, so that
        ICC_PROFILE_xxx atoms match, irrespective of which extension
        applications are using. This improves conformance to "ICC
        Profiles in X Specification 0.2".</li>
      <li>Improved ucmm install/load/delete to better respect
        systemlocal/user scopes, as well as eliminating need for profile
        name on delete when ucmm is used.</li>
      <li>Improve fast serial port scan to better detect Lumagen
        Radiance without upsetting it.</li>
      <li>Added ARGYLL_EXCLUDE_SERIAL_SCAN environment variable, to
        allow suppression of fast serial port scan of sensitive devices.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.9.1 -&gt; V1.9.2] 17th October 2016</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added CMYKOGB and CMYKRGB 7 channel ink preset, and made
        targen more flexible in matching pre-conditioning profiles to
        targen ink selection.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix oeminst for OS X save location.</li>
      <li>Fix oeminst for OS X Spyder 4 CD calibration file location.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.8.3 -&gt; V1.9.1] 28th September 2016</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved robustness of ChromeCast discovery, and added some
        minimal diagnostics.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Improved robustness of targen ofps patch generation when using
        less well behaved pre-conditioning profiles.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed oeminst so that it locates cdrom's in Linuxes latest
        mount point of /run/media/$USER/.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in i1pro2 driver, in which strip calibration would
        fail if instrument had been first calibrated with
        ARGYLL_DISABLE_I1PRO2_DRIVER set, and then calibrated with
        ARGYLL_DISABLE_I1PRO2_DRIVER unset.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added option to icclib to write Output profiles using 'chad'
        tag if the ARGYLL_CREATE_DISPLAY_PROFILE_WITH_CHAD&nbsp;
        environment variable is set. This is not recommended for normal
        use, but may assist compatibility with other systems.</li>
      <li>Added JETI spectraval support, including Bluetooth access.</li>
      <li>Added support for the Klein K10 connecting via a serial port.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in Colormunki Smile driver that causes crash on
        Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS.</li>
      <li>Modified "lp" intent to greatly reduce eliminate
        Helmholtz-Kohlrausch appearance modelling.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed problem with targen -g, in that the corresponding XYZ
        values had double the power applied, rather than none. This was
        causing problems with printtarg spacer colors.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Extensive re-write of colorimetric nearest clipping code in
        rspl/rev.c to restore precision that was lost in the speedups
        made in V1.0.0. The nnrev setup now takes a lot longer with
        &nbsp; high resolution CMYK profiles though. This corrects a
        "green becoming too yellow" problem for mapping from ProPhoto
        space with some RGB devices.</li>
      <li>Change dispwin to properly set X11 DirectColor and take
        account of TrueColor Colormap.&nbsp; This fixes problem with
        NVidia linux driver 364.12 exposing a VideoLUT depth that is
        different from the frame buffer depth.</li>
      <li>Change icclib to automatically repair icmTextDescription
        strings that have an allocation that is longer than their size.</li>
      <li>Added i1Pro Lamp Drift test and fix functions to spotread (-Y
        l|L options).</li>
      <li>Change colprof so that -s -S will accept general compression
        percentage as an alternative to a source colorspace/image gamut.</li>
      <li>Added optional conversion from native Gretag-MacBeth &amp;
        X-Rite reflective calibration standards to/from XRGA.</li>
      <li>Changed OS X GUI support code so as not to switch to "interact
        with the Dock" mode until actual GUI element is to be displayed.
        This prevents batch commands with optional GUI elements from
        blocking normal GUI interactions.</li>
      <li>Re-jigged OS X UI code to use the main thread to avoid window
        creation timing issues and a warning backtrace on OS X 10.11.</li>
      <li>Added CMP_Digital_Target-7.cht</li>
      <li>Fix spec2cie to cope with .ti3 files that are missing device
        values, so that it can process a wider range of input CIE
        reference files.</li>
      <li>Changed implementation of ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE on MSWin to
        make it more reliable when operated progromatically.</li>
      <li>Fixed chartread so that if you are reading patch by patch, the
        location strings can be arbitrary (i.e. they don't have to
        conform to an alpha/num strip/patch pattern.)</li>
      <li>Added support for Sencore ColorPro V, IV &amp; III
        colorimeters (based on Sequel Chroma colorimeter.).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.8.2 -&gt; V1.8.3] 26th October 2015</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added SpyderCheckr24 scaning .cht and .cie files.</li>
      <li>Fixed USB problem with i1pro (Rev B &amp; D ?), where
        communications would occasionally break down on fast systems.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added another fixed display intergration time to i1pro
        non-adaptive emission mode to cope with higher brightness
        displays.</li>
      <li>Added workaround for i1d3 Rev. B status code 0x83 on very low
        light measurement</li>
      <li>Fixed minor bug in i1d3.c that truncated serial number string.
        (Thanks to Mikael Sterner).</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in Klein K10 driver - adaptive measurement wasn't
        properly using all the extra measurements.</li>
      <li>Improved Klein K10 driver to be more robust when lights off
        command returns bogus error codes, or causes a cascade of bogus
        measurement errors.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added workaround for OS X 10.9+ "App Nap" problem.</li>
      <li>Added maximum sensor frequency check for Spyder &amp; i1d3
        drivers, so that erronious readings due to excessive brightness
        can't be missed.</li>
      <li>Changed chartread so that it doesn't warn of a possible wrong
        strip being read, nor allows bi-directional strip reading, if
        "printtarg -r" was used. A warning will be issued if "printtarg
        -r" was used, and "chartread -B" wasn't used.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed collink for eeColor Full range RGB to use output curve
        ("second" 1D curves) to compensate for cLUT being wired for 1.0
        output from 1.0 input.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added "lp" gamut mapping intent :- Luminance Preserving
        Perceptual, for Photographers concerned with maintaining tonal
        variations.</li>
      <li>Fixed bugs in image specific gamut mapping that were degrading
        the accuracy of the result.</li>
      <li>Re-wrote gamut smoothing code, and re-tuned it to behave
        similarly to the V1.8.2 release.</li>
      <li>Changed default viewing condition glare to 5%, to smooth out
        shadow tone curve.</li>
      <li>Reduced the level of Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect in CIECAM02
        implementation in the light of visual experiments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.8.1 -&gt; V1.8.2] 7th September 2015</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed endless loop bug in alternate calibration selectors
        code.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.8.0 -&gt; V1.8.1] 4th September 2015</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed bug in "spec2cie -n" wrong field indexes were being
        used.</li>
      <li>Fixed colorimeter calibration selectors to add in alternate
        selectors if the letters are free.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.7.0 -&gt; V1.8.0] 20th August 2015</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the Image Engineering EX1 spectroradiometer.</li>
      <li>Added support for the SwatchMate Cube reflective colorimeter,
        with improved accuracy.</li>
      <li>Added Added Television Lighting Consistency Index (EBU
        TLCI-2012 Qa)&nbsp; to spotread and specplot output.</li>
      <li>Added R9 value to CRI value in spotread and specplot output.</li>
      <li>Added workaround for JETI specbos having been calibrated by a
        3rd party, and its calibrated range being out of sync with its
        claimed range.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added support for "EMISINPUT" type .ti3 file.</li>
      <li>Build using OpenSSL rather than axTLS if it is built on Linux.</li>
      <li>Fixed stack space problem in OS X UI programs by expanding
        main thread proxy to have 8MB instead of the default 512K.</li>
      <li>Updated built in libtiff to V4.0.4beta.</li>
      <li>Changed CGATS format to not emit unknown keyword declaration
        ("KEYWORD") by default.</li>
      <li>Added inst_calc_cond_mask to inst.h to allow for flags in
        calibration conditions. A consequence of this is that calc needs
        to be masked with this when comparing against a specific
        condition, and the inst_calc_optional_flag should be cleared if
        it is set, before callint inst-&gt;calibrate() if the user wants
        to proceed with a particular calibration.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug with dispcal -e N</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in xicclu -fg and -kp</li>
      <li>Added dispcal -x x option to allow reading a chart and
        manually entering the XYZ values.</li>
      <li>Fix spyder4 &amp; 5 bug where some display types were set as
        refresh when they shouldn't be.</li>
      <li>Fix collink "Warning :- RGB black hack trigger more than
        once!" when -b is used with input video encoding (-e).</li>
      <li>Changed colprof so that the default ICC description is the
        base filename rather than the whole file path.</li>
      <li>Fix technology type and display type selector
        "uniqueification" bug&nbsp; that shows up in "ccxxmake -??".</li>
      <li>Add OEM field to ccmx and ccss files to mark files that have
        been installed from OEM disk, so that custom ccmx &amp; ccss
        files can be given suggested selector letter priority (+
        ref/CRT.ccss).</li>
      <li>Tweak CGATS write format to avoid scientific notation until
        the numbers are bigger and smaller (i.e until e6 and e-6 are
        needed).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.6.3 -&gt; V1.7.0] 1st May 2015</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved gamut mapping to reduce unnecessary changes to less
        saturated colors&nbsp; such as skin tones.</li>
      <li>Add support for DataColor Spyder 5.</li>
      <li>Add support for ColorHug2 colorimeter.</li>
      <li>Add support for Klein K10-A colorimeter.</li>
      <li>Added Google ChromeCast as a test patch generator for Video
        displays.</li>
      <li>Added ls2ti3 tool to convert LightSpace .bcs files to .ti3.</li>
      <li>Added IRIDAS .cube 3DLut format support to collink.</li>
      <li>Add X3D and X3DOM support as an alternative to VRML, and make
        X3DOM the default.</li>
      <li>Add better cross compatibility with non-Argyll ICC profiles
        using ArgyllCMS 'arts' tag to mark 'wtpt' Absolute Colorimetric
        chromaticity transform, as well as implement proper absolute
        colorimetric intent for Display profiles use the 'chad' tag.
        Note that the standard ICC profiles provided by ArgyllCMS in the
        ref directory (such as sRGB etc.) now include an 'arts' tag.</li>
      <li>Ignore any patches that have zero values for creating Display
        profiles, unless they are for device zero. </li>
      <li>Fix various instrument communications problems for JETI
        specbos, DTP20, DTP92 &amp; DTP94.</li>
      <li>Fix gestaltSystemVersion warning on OS X 10.10.</li>
      <li>Fix very major bug in illumread. It wasn't actually working at
        all since V1.4.0.</li>
      <li>Added collink -I[gG][:p.p]:x.x options that allows an output
        offset gamma curve be targetted instead of BT1886.</li>
      <li>Added dispcal and collink -b black point hack. This forces the
        input zero to map to the output zero for well behaved displays,
        reducing dependence on the instrument accuracy for a very dark
        black point.</li>
      <li>Added preset list of display techologies to select from in
        ccxxmake.</li>
      <li>Added a -P prune option to profcheck, that creates a .ti3 file
        pruned of any patches that have a delta E fit error greater than
        a threshold. This may be of use in eliminating bad reading
        values from a measurement set.</li>
      <li>Added histogram plot option -h to both profcheck and verify.</li>
      <li>Added a dispread &amp; fakeread -Z option to set the number of
        bits to quantize the test values to. </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in targen - the -V dark emphasis wasn't being
        applied to OFPS generated points.</li>
      <li>Make sure that if an instrument display reading is interrupted
        by a forced calibration, that the user is asked to place it back
        on the display before resuming the measurements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.6.2 -&gt; V1.6.3] 26th January 2014</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added ProPhoto.icm and ProPhotoLin.icm to ref profiles.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in xicclu -py conversion.</li>
      <li>Added code to minimize ICC rounding error on matrix profile
        white point accuracy. Re-generated all reference profiles with
        this change.</li>
      <li>Changed i1d3 driver to completely ignore any EEPROM checksum
        errors for non "A-01" rev. instruments.</li>
      <li>Made transplot handle RGB-&gt;RGB device link.</li>
      <li>Removed colprof -y option. Use "profcheck -v2" instead, as it
        is more developed.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in dispcal - it was not using the final measurement
        pass to update the calibration curves.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in spotread, dispcal &amp; dispread for CCSS capable
        instruments where refresh display types was being ignored if a
        custom observer was used, and/or the custom observer as being
        ignored, and/or a&nbsp; CCMX was being ignored. Changed instlib
        semantics for inst_opt_set_ccss_obs :- this is now set
        immediately, and applied also to any subsequent set_disptype()
        or col_cal_spec_set().</li>
      <li>Renamed verify to colverify to avoid clash with MSWin program
        of the same name. Made it print the patch location for -v2 if it
        is present in the file.</li>
      <li>Changed targen to ensure that -V and -p options effects are
        reflected in the resulting expected CIE values of the .ti1 file.</li>
      <li>Changed targen so that -V parameter also affects single
        channel, grey wedge, grid &amp; body centered grid point
        distribution.</li>
      <li>Changed colprof to deal with variable grid distribution in a
        more neuanced way, to reduce overshoot artifacts when the -V
        parameter is used.</li>
      <li>Changed colprof to used a power_like function for the grid
        distribution shape from the -V parameter, so as to avoid issues
        with a power curve infinte slope near zero.</li>
      <li>Changed colprof to used a scaled down value of the targen -V
        parameter as the default for its -V parameter. Documentation now
        recommends more moderate values for -V.</li>
      <li>Added a special case to collink for RGB video input encoding
        to (attempt) to fine tune the black point to compensate for it
        (probably) not falling on a cLUT grid point. &amp; out encoding</li>
      <li>Tweaked dispcal to try and improve accuracy of black point
        calibration.</li>
      <li>Switch dispread to use NoClamp readings, so that average black
        point value is not biased.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug introduced into 1.6.2 oeminst that prevents .ccss
        files being installed.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.6.1 -&gt; V1.6.2] 18th November 2013</h1>
    <ul>
      <li> Added "dark region emphasis" -V parameter to targen and
        colprof,&nbsp; in an attempt to improve the accuracy of display
        profiles intended for use with video. This should improve the
        subsequent black point accuracy of the profile.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug and tweaked dispcal black point optimization to err
        on the black side. Added -v3 for even more debugging
        information.</li>
      <li>Changed i1d3 driver to be more forgiving of EEProm checksum
        calculation, so that it works with the latest release "A-02"
        rev.&nbsp; i1 display pro &amp; colormunki display instruments,
        as well as improving its robustness in the face of errors.</li>
      <li>Fixed race condition bug in OS X HID driver. This fixes
        occassional problem with i1d3, and also solves problem with the
        ColorHug on OS X. </li>
      <li>Fixed problem with TV encoded output and dispread -E -k/-K.</li>
      <li>Fixed minor bug in DE94 in icclib.</li>
      <li>Fixed major bug in illumread - result was being corrupted.</li>
      <li>Fixed "edges don't match" bug in printarg when -iCM -h -s/-S
        used.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in -H flag in ccxxmake, chartread, dispcal, dispread,
        illumread &amp; spotread so that it works once again.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Fix bug in "average -m"<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix oeminst to work with a wider range of i1d3 install files.</li>
      <li>Fix ColorMunki reflective measurement accuracy, particularly
        for reflective readings. This has been poor since V1.5</li>
      <li>Fix bug in using DTP94 on Apple OS X introduced in V1.5</li>
      <li>Fix MadVR connect code to look for appropriate 32 bit or 64
        bit .dll.</li>
      <li>Improve MSWin system driver installation by creating valid
        ArgyllCMS.cat file to match ArgyllCMS.inf. This eliminates the
        need to "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement", as well as
        allowing installation on MSWin&nbsp; 8.1.<br>

    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.5.1 -&gt; V1.6.0] 16th August 2013</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for <b>JETI</b> specbos 1211 and 1201 (Thanks
        to JETI for their support!)</li>
      <li>Added Video profiling &amp; 3dLut creation support for eeColor
        and MadVR. See video section in tutorial for pointers to
        relevant changes to tools. This includes support for MadTPG +
        various Video standard ICC profiles + verification workflow.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Linux profile installation will use <b>colord</b> if
        libcolordcompat.so is present on system.</li>
      <li>Fix <b>ColorHug</b> driver so that it is backwards compatible
        with FW 1.1.8</li>
      <li>Made sure that MSWin test colors are not color managed. This
        may affect Vista, Win7 and Win8.</li>
      <li>Changed spectro/dispwin.c so that null transform color
        matching is used for displaying test patches on OS X &gt;= 10.6.
        This should fix calibrating/profiling secondary displays on &gt;
        OS X 10.6. Note that the 32 bit 10.4 binary will still have
        problems on &gt; OS X 10.6.</li>
      <li>Changed <b>instlib API</b> ambient XYZ and spectral units to
        Lux. In previous versions of instlib they were Lux/pi.</li>
      <li>For those instruments that support it, made ambient readings
        honor refresh mode measurements, to improve repeatability when
        measuring regularly flickering light sources. (specbos, i1d3,
        i1disp).</li>
      <li>Changed spotread -ew mode to be Bradford chromatic transform
        rather than XYZ scaling, to better match Argyll ICC abs. vs.
        rel.</li>
      <li>Added support to xicclu to lookup colors though CAL files,
        both forward and backwards. Will also plot CAL file contents
        using -g.</li>
      <li>Added -Y R:rate option to spotread, dispcal, dispread &amp;
        ccxxmake to allow setting a chosen display refresh rate. This
        can be used with the Colormunki display, as well as situations
        in which refresh rate measurement is not reliable.</li>
      <li>By default printtarg will create PS and EPS files with a CUPS
        job ticket to disable color management. Use the -U flag to
        disable this.</li>
      <li>Added display update delay calibration support to i1pro and
        ColorMunki (just like i1disp3), to improve measurement times.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal &amp; dispread so that they wait up to 0.5
        seconds when reading dark patches after light ones to allow for
        display fall time. Added&nbsp; patch order optimization for
        display patch sets in targen to minimize the extra time.</li>
      <li>Changed dispwin daemon loader mode option from -E to -X. Added
        -E option to encode test patch colors in Video 16-235 range.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal verify option from -E to -z. Added -E option
        to encode test patch colors in Video 16-235 range.</li>
      <li>Added -E option to to dispread to encode test patch colors in
        Video 16-235 range.</li>
      <li>Changed CIECAM02 Flare model to distinguish between Flare from
        the image itself, and Glare from ambient light. This allows
        scaling Glare with ambient automatically. Changed enumerated
        viewing conditions for new Flare/Glare settings, changed all to
        Flareless to improve dark image behavior, while retaining Glare
        modelling. Tweaked brightness and ambient values.</li>
      <li>Improved i1pro hi-res mode to improve accuracy.</li>
      <li>Added Body Centered Cubic grid option to targen.</li>
      <li>Added -Yn flag to dispcal and dispread, which skips asking the
        user to place the instrument on the measuring spot.</li>
      <li>Improve robustness of i1d3 display update measurement code.</li>
      <li>Added support for applying calibration curves in collink.</li>
      <li>Changed spotread so that it won't fall back to emissive spot
        mode if an ambient reading is requested.</li>
      <li>Turned off B2A table clip map smoothing, as it seems to
        introduce reversals for some data sets, and provides little
        benefit.</li>
      <li>Fixed crash in ucmm/ucmm.c when loading certain profiles using
        dispwin (thanks to Torok Edwin).</li>
      <li>Fixed gamut mapping intent "rl" to really use relative L*a*b*</li>
      <li>Fix bug in cicam02 in V1.5.0 that causes some mapping problems
        in the red for collink -ir or -ila.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Changed cctiff so that it does lossless JPEG copy when there
        is no color transformation. This makes it more useful for
        embedding a profile.</li>
      <li>Fix xicclu so that it works with device links.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in shaper/matrix profile curves that caused random
        bumpy black behaviour (shaper curve optimization local minimum
        problem).</li>
      <li>Don't add colorant tag to .tiff files in cctiff unless it is a
        non-standard space, as Photoshop will barf on such files.</li>
      <li>Fix bug with Spyder not being able to break out of dispcal
        adjustment loop.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in xicc/xicclu, -K flag not being recognised.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in xicc/xmatrix.c introduced in V1.5 that prevents

    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.5.0 -&gt; V1.5.1] 8th March 2013</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix spectro/instlib.ksh and standalone instlib build.</li>
      <li>Turned off debug plot on using FWA.</li>
      <li>Changed link $(LINKFLAGS) location in link command line
        Jambase to get latest gcc working.</li>
      <li>Fixed new bug in matrix display profile creation that causes
        an inaccurate relative white point. This causes Photoshop to

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.4.0 -&gt; V1.5.0] 1st March 2013</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased ease of selecting ISO 13655:2009 M0, M1 and M2
        measurements using FWA comensation using any spectrometer that
        can take non-UV filtered measurements. M0, M1 or M2 can now be
        selected directly using the -f flag. [ArgyllCMS has been
        supporting ISO 13655 M0, M1 &amp; M2 well before the standard
        was created, thanks to its FWA compensation feature.]<br>
      </li>
      <li>Increased stability of i1d3 refresh display measurements by
        increasing integration time, and tweaking crossover from
        frequency to period measurement.</li>
      <li>Added i1pro Rev E (i1pro2) feature support. Uses RevE
        measurement mode, and does wavelength calibration. Uses RevE
        (internal) stray light reduction, and black level temperature
        compensation. The only Rev E feature not currently supported is
        U.V. measurement, which would improve the accuracy of FWA
        compensation. Rev E driver can be disabled and the legacy driver
        mode used by setting the ARGYLL_DISABLE_I1PRO2_DRIVER
        environment variable.</li>
      <li>Changed i1pro adaptive mode to avoid high gain mode, so as to
        give more consistent and longer integration times for low light
        levels.</li>
      <li>Changed ColorMunki adaptive mode to avoid high gain mode, so
        as to give more consistent and longer integration times for low
        levels. Added black level temperature compensation.</li>
      <li>Added spotread interactive function 'f' to read out the
        calibrate display refresh rate for instruments that have a
        refresh display mode, as well as an 'F' function that measures
        the refresh rate for instruments that support a refresh rate
        measurement function (colorimeters &amp; spectrometers).</li>
      <li>The Display Type selection option -y in dispcal, dispread,
        chartread, spotread &amp; ccxxmake now lists installed CCSS and
        CCMX files as a selection, rather than using the -X parameter.
        CCMX and CCSS files now have extra fields to indicate the
        refresh mode, an optional list of default UI selection
        characters, and (for CCMX files) the base display type they
        apply over (CB-n).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Tweaked CIECAM02 to improve behavior for extreme blue colors,
        so that the hue doesn't swing too far towards the cyan. This
        helps in the clipping behavior from colorspaces such as
        ProPhotoRGB.</li>
      <li>Made the input profile cLUT extra neutral axis extrapolation
        points the default for colprof -u and non -u profiles. Changed
        -u algorithm to work similarly to -U scale :- it sets the scale
        automatically. Relative colorimetric is therefore hue matched to
        the white reference patch, Removed colprof -un, as it seems
        unnecessary. Added colprof -uc, which clips cLUT colors over Y =
        1 to white.</li>
      <li>The spyd2en, spyd4en and i1d3ccss tools have been combined
        into, and replaced by a single oeminst tool.</li>
      <li>Fix problem with dispwin/dispcal/dispread -dweb and the latest
        Safari browser.</li>
      <li>Changed to a single ArgyllCMS.inf file for MSWin USB driver
        installation. This eases installation of more than a single type
        of instrument. Tested on MS Windows 8 and updated installation
        instructions.</li>
      <li>Dropped libusb for USB access, using native USB access
        instead. MSWin uses the libusb-win32 kernel driver. Moved the
        usb setup files from libusb1 to a new directory, usb.</li>
      <li>Added scanin support for ColorCheckerPassort.</li>
      <li>Updated OS X code to compile on 10.6 and 10.7 and (presumably)
        10.8 (64 bit compatible API used when compiling on those
        platforms, including Cocoa for the test patch window).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed udev file usb/55-Argyll.rules to eliminate the test
        for /lib/udev/udev-acl as a condition of using ACL_MANAGE, since
        I'm informed that it is deprecated in recent distribution
        releases (but who can tell, given the churn in the udev API).</li>
      <li>Deprecated -V flag (adaptive mode) in dispcal, dispread and
        ccxxmake, since this is now the default. Flag will be ignored
        with a warning. Added -ZA flag instead, to select non-adaptive
        integration time mode.</li>
      <li>spotread -d flag is deprecated, and is now a synonym for the
        -e flag, since it defaults to adaptive mode. Added -ZA flag
        instead, to select non-adaptive integration time mode. Also
        added -Zr and -ZR flags to allow testing of the refresh mode
        overrides.</li>
      <li>Migrated ArgyllCMS specific application runtime files (such as
        instrument blobs, calibration state &amp; calibration files) to
        an "ArgyllCMS" sub-directory rather than the generic "color"
        directory. On OS X also moved data files to below the
        "Application Support" sub directory. The old locations will be
        used as a fallback.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added support for Quato Silver Haze 3 OEM i1d3<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added support for X-Rite ColorMunki Smile colorimeter.</li>
      <li>Enable the ColorHug by default, although it isn't advertised
        as supported, since it doesn't yet work reliably on OS X.
        Updated ColorHug PCI VID &amp; PID</li>
      <li>For Spyder, emit a warning rather than error if the feature
        bits are missing for calibration tables.</li>
      <li>Added automatic adjustment of patch reading delay for i1d3, so
        that a more conservative (longer) default value (200 msec) can
        be used without impacting i1d3 speed. Also added environment
        variable ARGYLL_MIN_DISPLAY_UPDATE_DELAY_MS that can set a
        different minimum update delay.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug introduced in V1.3.6 that stops the dtp41 from
        being initialized properly.</li>
      <li>Improved black level readings derived from spectral values by
        allowing them to be -ve. <br>
      </li>
      <li>The instlib API has been modified quite extensively to make it
        more self contained and flexible, although the basic
        architecture remains the same.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.7 -&gt; V1.4.0] 20th April 2012</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Modified spectro/ccxxmake so that a colorimeter can be used as
        a reference to make ccmx files if two .ti3 files are used. Added
        ref/ccxx.ti1 as convenient way of creating ccmx .ti3 files.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added dither/screening support for 8 bit output of render, and
        then made it available in target/printtarg.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added JPEG file support to imdi/cctiff, xicc/tiffgamut and
        xicc/extracticc. ICC profiles embedded in JPEG files can now be
        used anywhere a TIFF file with embedded ICC profile can be used
        as a source of an ICC profile.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed memory leaks in usbio.c, xdg_bds.c &amp; conv.c</li>
      <li>Fixed double memory free bug in icc/icc.c when iccdump'ing a
        profile that has a duplicate tag.</li>
      <li>Changed license of xicc/ccmx.[ch] to GPL2+.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Made display calibration and profile making deal with displays
        without hardware calibration support (VideoLUT support) more
        graceful. Added tutorial section covering this.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added option to dispwin/dispcal/dispread/ccxxmake to redirect
        the test patches to a web browser via a local web server. This
        augments Argyll's existing local and remote display capability.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in spectro/i1d3.c which results in NAN if a low
        level readings drops to zero at a particular time. Improved
        refresh rate calibration accuracy. Fixed bugs in adaptive
        measurement logic that caused a channel to be pre-measured when
        it shouldn't. This seems to noticeably improve repeatability on
        refresh displays.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in ucmm/jcnf where it was failing to locate the
        correct profile for a display.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix bugs in ColorMunki Transmissive measurement mode
        calibration.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.6 -&gt; V1.3.7] 26th March 2012</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix regression in Spyder support - ccmx files were not being
        handled (bug introduced in 1.3.6).</li>
      <li>Fix packaging problem - Spyder4 MSWin .inf file was missing.</li>
      <li>Change dispwin so that it will install a profile when there is
        no access to the display VideoLUT if the profile has no vcgt.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.5 -&gt; V1.3.6] 19th March 2012<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added Spyder4 support. Note the need for spyd4en for access to
        a full range of Manufacturers calibrations. The Spyder4 can use
        .ccss calibration files too. Speeded up all Spyder instrument
        readings on brighter colors.</li>
      <li>Experimental ColorHug support is compiled in, but is disabled
        unless the environment variable "ENABLE_COLORHUG" is set. The
        ColorHug currently doesn't seem to work reliably across all
        platforms ArgyllCMS supports.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed and expanded display selection (-y flag) to be
        instrument specific. This is to support the Spyder4 and
        ColorHug, and adds a refresh display selection to the i1d3.</li>
      <li>Tweaked i1d3 integration times and added accurate refresh
        period calibration to the refresh display mode. Refresh display
        measurement times are double non-refresh displays. Improved i1d3
        period measurement logic to improve measurement speed and
        accuracy for dark colors.</li>
      <li>Changed i1disp measurement logic to try and make it more
        robust against light to dark changes during a reading. This may
        make it slightly less precise for LCD displays on bright colors
        (equivalent now to Refresh display precision).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added a -V option to spotread to allow tracking reading
        consistency.</li>
      <li>Changed ccxxmake to create default .ccss with just&nbsp; RGBW,
        and not to weight W. This may give better matching. Made
        corresponding change to CCMX, giving the white patch 1/4
        weighting of sum of all other patches.</li>
      <li>Fixed applycal so that it applies calibration to both A2B and
        B2A tables, to preserve softproofing.</li>
      <li>Fixed timeout in SpectroScanT reference transmission
        measurement. (Someone kindly donated me a SpectroScanT to test
        with!)</li>
      <li>Made DTP94 driver ignore with a warning any
        NEEDS_OFFSET_DRIFT_CAL_ERR after a full reset. It seems that
        occasionally a few instruments do this, and X-Rite don't appear
        to be prepared to treat this as an instrument fault.</li>
      <li>Added support for Datacolor SpyderCheckr (Thanks to Jos
        Pereira).</li>
      <li>Improved the ability of spyd2en to cope with slightly
        different setup.exe formats.</li>
      <li>Add support for NEC SpectraSensor Pro version of the i1d3.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.4 -&gt; V1.3.5] 24th October 2011</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix bug (crash) that affects ColorMunki design/photo display
        measurement. This also stops it restoring a calibration (-N
        flag).</li>
      <li>Add support for the OEM version of the i1d3.</li>
      <li>Fix bug that stopped ccxxmake being able to make ccmx's.</li>
      <li>Tweak gamut mapping to improve dark area mapping,
        non-monotonic profile inversion, and contrast preservation to
        small gamut.</li>
      <li>Kill i1ProfileTray.exe process if unable to open i1d3 on
        MSWin.</li>
      <li>Fix DTP20 chart printing - TID was sometimes incomplete. This
        shows up on a 4x6 chart.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.3 -&gt; V1.3.4] 31st August 2011</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the X-Rite i1 Display Pro and ColorMunki
        Display colorimeters. As part of this, added support for CCSS
        calibration files for the instruments and added CCSS support to
        ccxxmake (renamed from ccmxmake). Provide new tool i1d3ccss to
        translating and installing CCSS files as well as the
        manufacturers calibration files for these instruments. Added
        non-default observer support for these instruments too.</li>
      <li>Fix gamut code to ignore setting primary/secondary cusps that
        are unlikely to be true. This avoids buggy gamut mapping
        behavior for gamuts that are very small and odd shaped.</li>
      <li>Changed Linux USB code to avoid doing a
        set_configuration&nbsp; if possible, since the USB driver does
        this by default. This then avoids triggering a bug in the
        Spyder2, which allows it to work on Linux version without the
        reset_ep fix, and may also allow the Spyder to work better with
        USB hubs.</li>
      <li>Change printtarg for DTP20 to allow for variable patch size.</li>
      <li>Changed dummy display matrix table to have channels rotated
        rather than R &amp; G swapped, to make it more obvious.</li>
      <li>Added option to colprof to allow setting the default profile
        rendering intent.</li>
      <li>Enhanced spectro/fakeread so that it will process a .ti3 file
        that has been renamed to .ti1.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in matrix input profile white point selection, + add
        in slight neutral bias code used in clut profiles.</li>
      <li>New profcheck -I wasn't working - fix option parsing.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed compiler dependant bug in Eye-One pro and (possibly)
        Munki high res. spectral wavelength calculation.</li>
      <li>Add support for install variables DESTDIR and PREFIX in
        Jamtop. These can be set on the command line using "jam -s"</li>
      <li>Added targen -N parameter to allow adjustment of neutral axis
        patch density emphasis, as well as increasing the default. This
        should improve the result without needing to add explicit grey
        test patches.</li>
      <li>Added spectro/instlib.ksh script to assemble all the files
        needed for a standalone instrument library. Changed licence to
        GPLv2 for the files included in the instlib.zip file that is
        thus created. See spectro/instlib.txt for more details.</li>
      <li>Fix Jambase so that recent MingW compilers don't need extra
        .dll's</li>
      <li>Change Linux serial code to test ports using O_NONBLOCK</li>
      <li>Modify xspect &amp; illumread to improve realism of UV
        spectrum estimation.</li>
      <li>Fixed profile/txt2ti3 so that a sample name that looks like an
        integer is treated as text. (Fixes problem with latest
        ProfileMaker file).</li>
      <li>Added LCh option to spotread.</li>
      <li>Fixed numerical issue in scanin/scanrd.c, where large input
        rasters would cause fitting to fail.</li>
      <li>Modified colprof input chart white patch detection to slightly
        favour patches that are close to D50 neutral.</li>
      <li>Increase the default XYZ PCS A2B profile default smoothness.</li>
      <li>Improved cLUT input -u black &amp; white&nbsp; point
        extrapolation.</li>
      <li>Improved black point determination for devices that have
        extremely narrow gamuts doe to the use of custom inks.</li>
      <li>Added -Z option to colprof, to allow setting ICC attribute
        flags.</li>
      <li>Fix CIECAM02 to better match forward and backwards, to fix
        perceptual table white point.</li>
      <li>Add code to override X-Rite's new OS X drivers for ColorMunki
        and EyeOne. Note new installation instructions
        &lt;http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/Installing_OSX.html&gt;.</li>
      <li>Added -R flag to colprof, which restricts the range of the
        white, black for better compatibility with other programs.</li>
      <li>Fixed typo bug that prevented flash measurement mode from
        working.</li>
      <li>Replaced spectro/average with a new version that is more
        general.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in printcal not working with spectral only files.</li>
      <li>Added extra verbose output to printcal in which it computes an
        ideal power-like value to apply to the test chart values in
        targen.</li>
      <li>Modify the way that XYZ cLUT B2A tables are indexed, so that
        the white point is at the top corner of the grid.This should
        solve Photoshop CS4/CS5 complaining that XYZ LUT profiles are
        'defective'.</li>
      <li>Added option in xicc/xicclu to plot an arbitrary slice.</li>
      <li>Expand the number of i1 Display OEM devices that can be used.</li>
      <li>Made some changes to help compile on FreeBSD.</li>
      <li>Added another intent, "pa", Perceptual Appearance, which is
        the same as perceptual except that the grey axes are not forced
        into alignment, allowing the appearance parameters to have full
        affect, including altering the chromatic mapping.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in txt2ti3 - it wasn't creating an iRGB colorspace
        file for output device RGB files, causing warnings warnings and
        failures when mixed with other iRGB tool sequences. </li>
      <li>Added pathological case fix for target/ofps where the ink
        limit == di-2. </li>
      <li>targen was failing to proceed when fixed points happened to be
        numerically just over the total ink limit.</li>
      <li>Added more navigation options for chartread patch by patch
        mode.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Fixed bug in "chartread -r -H" that caused resume of
        i1Pro high res to fail with "The resumed spectral type seems to
        have changed".</li>
      <li>Modified profcheck so that it prints patch location if it is
        present in the .ti3 file.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal and dispread -K option to -J. Added -K option
        to dispcal as an alternate way of profiling a calibrated
        display, and also added a -K option to dispcal. </li>
      <li>Increased ColorMunki emissive auto scaling target "over"
        margin from 5% to 10% to allow more room for instrument drift
        during measurement.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Fix bug in winusb + i1Display, where dark CRT
        measurements timeout.</li>

      <li>Turn off debugging that was accidentally left on in FWA code.
        Add gcc 3.3 PPC optimizer bug workaround to FWA code in
        xicc/xspect.c</li>
      <li>Change shaper/matrix profile back to using power curve as 0th
        order shape. Improve it with input &amp; output offsets and
        straight segment at zero. Make cLUT input -u black &amp; white
        point extrapolation use pure shaper curves with special tweaks.</li>
      <li>Increase dispcal native white target weighting from 10 to 50
        to encourage white to be device 1.0,1.0,1.0 more strongly.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed MSWIN Vista/Win7 problem where having Task Manager
        running would stop display test window updating. Also fixed plot
        library to avoid the same problem.</li>
      <li>Swapped dispwin -E and -D flags, to make -D debug consistent
        throughout tools.</li>
      <li>Changed the ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE mode so that all return and
        line feed characters are ignored, so that they can be used
        freely to flush stdin without triggering anything.</li>
      <li>Fixed endless loop problem with chartread -r -p on fully read
        chart.</li>
      <li>Added -S option to chartread, that suppresses wrong strip and
        unexpected value warnings.</li>
      <li>Fix dispcal and spotread so that color temperature takes into
        account any non-standard observer (ie. the color temperature is
        the closest point on the spectrum locus as determined by the
        chosen observers interpretation of the Plancian or daylight
        spectrum.)</li>
      <li>Fix bug in libusb1 triggered on systems that support bulk
        continuation (Linux)</li>
      <li>Added 1964_10c observer to spectro/dispcal, to better allow
        comparison to the default numbers.</li>
      <li>Added recognition for Huey built into Lenovo W series Laptops.</li>
      <li>Fixed chartread/dispsup/spotread etc. so that -N isn't fatal
        if the instrument doesn't support it.</li>
      <li>Fixed dispcal to disable black &amp; white drift tracking
        during interactive adjustment.</li>

      <li>Added option to <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispcal</span>
        and dispread that attempts to counteract instrument black drift
        and display white drift (-I option). This may help with
        instruments that haven't properly acclimatised to the

        spectrometer is being used.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added new utility spectro/<span style="font-weight: bold;">ccmxmake</span>,
        which makes Colorimeter Correction Matrices for a particular
        Colorimeter + Display combination, using a Spectrometer as a
        reference. The resulting <span style="font-weight: bold;">.ccmx</span>
        file can then be used with <span style="font-weight: bold;">spotread/dispcal/dispread</span>
        (-X option) to improve the&nbsp; accuracy of the colorimeter on

          href="Scenarios.html#PM6">here</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in spotread's handling of emissive measurements. If
        the XYZ was computed from spectral, it was using a D50 white
        instead of no white reference.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in i1pro normal resolution wavelength calibration,
        introduced in V1.2.0.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed libusb V1.0 name to libusb-1.0A, so as not to clash
        with any official but different libusb V1.0 installation. [This
        may necessitate re-installing device drivers on MSWin.]</li>
      <li>Added support for HP DreamColor version of the i1 display.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix problem with ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE - reading from
        instruments was not actually possible, because polling for input
        was disabled.</li>
      <li>Adjust ColorMunki dark threshold to reduce misread reports.
        Add inconsistent data to debug output. Fix bug in adaptive mode
        - the integration time was sometimes&nbsp; too short. Set
        adaptive emissive target at 95% to allow a little more margin to
        saturation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix problem with ColorMunki reporting erroneous inconsistent
        measurement errors. This shows up on display calibration.</li>
      <li>Fix some minor compiler warnings.</li>
      <li>Added direction indicators to xy values in dispcal
        interactive&nbsp; monitor adjustments. </li>
      <li>Fix bug in CIECAM02 viewing condition settings :- the
        enumerated conditions after "mt" are displaced by 1. (ie. "mt"
        is really "pc", "mb" is "mt", "md" is "mb" etc.) Added option
        -c:sn for auto surround from the Lv parameter (-c:l).</li>

    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-worked gamut mapping to improve perceptual intent
        saturation levels, as well as improve highlight and shadow
        contrast. Added fine tuning to improve both smoothness and the
        precision with which the source is mapped to the destination.</li>
      <li>Added illumread, which allows measuring an illuminant and
        estimating its UV content, for better accuracy with FWA
        compensation.</li>
      <li>Use a modified/forked version of libusb V1.0, that supports
        Win2K (libusb0.sys) back end by default. Supports 64 but MSWin
        using a combination of WinUSB.sys and ptlibusb0.sys. [ The HCFR
        does not work on Win 64 bit though, due to its buggy USB
        implementation. ] NOTE that the included version of Libusb V1
        has been carefully tested with all supported instruments on all
        supported platforms,&nbsp; and includes many bug fixes needed
        for correct functioning. While bug fixes have been fed upstream,
        not all have been adopted. In particular there is a nasty race
        condition that has not, and may never be fixed upstream, as well
        as missing critical functionality (clearep()).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Modified colprof -p to allow different abstract profiles to be
        applied for each intent.</li>
      <li>Added -I option (imitation) to printcal, so that an existing
        devices response can be set as a target.</li>
      <li>Increase target/ofps.c vertex intersection retries from 10 to
        40 to give it a better chance of working with difficult
        profiles.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in plot that shows up on XP+, where the window isn't
        dismissed by the first keystroke, but only after it has been
        moved or resized.</li>
      <li>Changed CMYK black point to be natural, rather than the
        darkest point in the same direction and K only. This may wreck K
        only to black point matching, but it will stop printers with
        funny colored K ink from messing up the black point.</li>
      <li>Make Lacie Blue Eye colorimeter appear as an i1display.</li>
      <li>Improved i1pro matching to Original Manufacturers Driver (see
        doc/i1proDriver.html).</li>
      <li>Improved i1pro/ColorMunki patch recognition for better
        uniformity.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in ColorMunki driver scan mode calibration when
        instrument is more sensitive than usual.</li>

        is to include the margin.</li>
      <li>Fixed several build bugs in imdi code related to 64 bits.</li>
      <li>Fixed profile/colprof -u so that it is applied to matrix
        profiles too</li>
      <li>Changed tiffgamut to use one pass gamut hull finding and
        modified the smoothing so as to end up with a more closely
        wrapped volume.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in input matrix profiles introduced by the XYZ cLUT
        display matrix profile change, where the correct white and black
        point weren't being written.</li>
      <li>Added matrix only/linear algorithm option to profile/colprof,
        for raw camera profiling.</li>
      <li>Modified libusb/55-Argyll.rules for better compatibility with
        systems that have ACL installed but no ConsoleKit. Also set
        ID_VENDOR and ID_MODEL using. usb-db.</li>
      <li>Modified target/targen to cope better with case where adding
        nodes fails to determine vertex positions a lot of the time,
        causing extreme slowdown.</li>
      <li>Fixed colprof so that the per channel input curves for XYZ PCS
        B2A tables are actually scaled correctly.</li>
      <li>Changed link/collink to apply Y to L* curve if the input or
        output space is XYZ. Fixed the Y to L* scaling to make sure it
        only apples to XYZ space, and that the L* non-linearisation
        still applies to Y like device spaces.</li>
      <li>Modified scanin so that it ignores any alpha channels in the
        input .tiff file.</li>
      <li>Changed printcal so that it will create .AMP file with more
        than 4 channels. Also fixed up plotting to plot up to 10
        channels.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal and dispread so that a request for projector
        mode falls back to display mode if the instrument doesn't
        support a projector mode.</li>
      <li>Updated ref/CMP_Digital_Target-3.cht as it seems that the
        reference chart has columns labelled "2A - 2D" rather than the

    <ul>
      <li>Spyder3 and ColorMunki Design, Photo and Create instrument
        support.</li>
      <li>Added a complete printer calibration system. This can work
        either with a print system that supports per channel print
        calibration curves, or purely using ICC profiling mechanisms.</li>
      <li>Default targen (OFPS) test point distribution has been
        re-written to generate test points on the gamut surface, refine
        the point locations when using a guide profile, and use a better
        error estimate model to determine the test point locations. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed chartread strip reading mode to allow navigating about
        the strips, saving a partially read chart, and resuming a

        volume if the two gamuts are incompatible.</li>
      <li>Improved CMYK black generation control and smoothness near the
        black point.</li>
      <li>Improved collink special black and colorant handling so that
        the gamut mapping is consistent&nbsp; with the special black and
        colorant mapping</li>
      <li>Changed profile/colprof to generate matrix tags for Display
        XYZ PCS cLUT profiles, to improve compatibility with other CMMs.<br>
        By default (-ax) the matrix tags will be a dummy transform that
        swaps red and green, while using -aX will create real matrix
        tags.</li>
      <li>Added -V option to dispcal and dispread to allow use of i1pro
        adaptive mode to give better low level consistency.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal to default to -f 1.0 (assume black is all
        output offset) to make it work in more sympathy to a typical
        display response. Also changed default gamma to 2.4 for OS X
        10.6 systems.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Improved X11 XRandR CRTC detection.</li>
      <li>Added spotread option to save spectral reading of an
        illuminant to a .sp file.</li>
      <li>Added Color Rendering Index (Ra) to spotread measurement
        results.</li>
      <li>Added i1pro &amp; ColorMunki flash measurement
        support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Improve reliability of detecting backwards read i1pro/Munki
        strips.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in i1pro driver that subtly affected accuracy.</li>
      <li>Modified xicc/cam02 to clip the blue to avoid crazy behavior
        outside the spectrum locus.</li>
      <li>Simplified the Linux installation instructions, particularly
        with regard to USB and serial permissions.</li>
      <li>Added working MSWindows 64 bit libusb drivers, which will work
        on Vista 64 and MSWindows 7 64 bit. Because of Microsoft's
        driver signing requirements though, they won't be usable unless
        a driver code signing workaround is used.</li>
      <li>Changed printtarg so that the TIFF output has the paper margin
        subtracted from it. This is so that the resulting TIFF can be
        placed on that sized paper without clipping or scaling. Set the
        margin to zero to get a TIFF that exactly fits into the
        specified paper size</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Modify icc/icclib to protect against integer overflow
        exploits, and fixes to minor bugs. Bump icclib version to 2.11
        to reflect this.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix bug in spectro/hidio.c that can cause a crash (bus error)
        on OS X for any program that accesses the instruments.</li>
